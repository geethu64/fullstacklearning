    <h1>CSS LEVELS</h1>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets does not have versions in the traditional sense; instead it has levels. Each level of CSS
        builds on the previous, refining definitions and adding features. The feature set of each higher level is a
        superset of any lower level, and the behavior allowed for a given feature in a higher level is a subset of that
        allowed in the lower levels. A user agent conforming to a higher level of CSS is thus also conformant to all
        lower levels.

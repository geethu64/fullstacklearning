    <h1> css cascading style sheet</h1>
    <p>
        When the first CSS specification was published, all of CSS was contained in one document that defined CSS Level
        1. CSS Level 2 was defined also by a single, multi-chapter document. However for CSS beyond Level 2, the CSS
        Working Group chose to adopt a modular approach, where each module defines a part of CSS, rather than to define
        a single monolithic specification. This breaks the specification into more manageable chunks and allows more
        immediate, incremental improvement to CSS.</p>

                    The trick is to add Â½ pound of chopped mushrooms to every pound of ground beef in your burger
                    recipe. Doing this will result in incredibly juicy and flavorful burgers - and you won't even
                    realize the mushrooms are there! Really and truly

                    Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched or
                    extruded, into long strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried
                    and stored for future use.

                <p>

                    At a typical fish fry, quantities of fish (such as bream, catfish, flounder and bass) available
                    locally are battered and deep-fried in cooking oil. The batter usually consists of corn meal, milk
                    or buttermilk, and seasonings.

                <p>
                    Oats with milk and fresh fruits: One of the easiest way to have oats is with some warm milk, fresh
                    fruits, nuts and seeds. You can even use coconut milk and sweet berries. Take a bowl of warm milk
                    then add half a cup of dry roasted oats along with everything that your heart desires.
